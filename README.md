# Indian Food Recognition  

## Overview  
This project is a machine learning-based system for recognizing Indian food items from images. The models are **trained on individual food images** but **tested on composite images** containing multiple food items. The goal is to **detect and label multiple known food items** in unseen composite images.  

The system supports three different models:  

- **Multiclass Classification Model** – A single model trained on all individual images and labels, predicting the most likely food category per image.  
- **Multi-Label Model** – A separate model is trained for each food item, enabling detection of multiple foods in a composite image.  
- **Pretrained ResNet-50 Model** – Fine-tuned for Indian food classification, leveraging transfer learning for feature extraction.  
 

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of **20 Indian food classes**, each containing approximately **300 images** of isolated food items. The models were trained on these **individual images** and later tested on **composite images** with multiple foods.
